We Use
YARN
MESOS
StandAlone and many more for Spark.

But there are some more tools available for CLUSTER MONITORING

1. GANGLIA
2.PROMETHEUS

GANGLIA eg: Amozon EMR
===========
Ganglia is cluster monitoring tool to monitor the health of distributed cluster of spark and hadoop.
Ganglia is a scalable, distributed monitoring tool for high-performance computing systems, clusters and networks.
It is used to view either live or recorded statistics covering metrics such as CPU load averages or network utilization for many nodes

rrdtool ---> the Round-Robin Database, is a tool thatâ€™s used to store and display the variation of data over time using graphs.

ganglia-gmetad---->the daemon that collects monitoring data from the hosts that you want to monitor. 

In those hosts and in the master node it is also necessary to install ganglia-gmond (the monitoring daemon itself).
gmond----> gmond is monitoring deamon which collect data from each node in the cluster and send it to specific host.
ganglia-web ----> provides the web frontend where we will view the historical graphs and data about the monitored systems.

PROMETHEUS e.g: Docker Container
========== ===

Prometheus works well for recording any purely numeric time series. 
It fits both machine-centric monitoring as well as monitoring of highly dynamic service-oriented architectures.
In a world of microservices, its support for multi-dimensional data collection and querying is a particular 

Grafana --- It is a dashboard.
