Profiling
==========

We can use jvisualvm to profile even Spark Job. With help of this we can go to granular level of debugging to a Spark Job.
This utility shows stats like memory used, heap data, garbage collector, and CPU profiling.

Spark runs the executors in individual Java Virtual Machines (JVMs).

jstack ---> for providing stack traces
jmap   ---> for creating heapdumps
jstat  ---> for reporting timeâ€“series statistics
jconsole -> for visually exploring various JVM properties
